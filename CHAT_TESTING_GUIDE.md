# Quick Start: Testing the New Chat Feature

## What Was Added

A new **💬 Chat** tab in the Gradio web interface that enables multi-turn conversations with your documents.

## Files Modified

1. **`vector/web/components.py`** - Added chat UI components
2. **`vector/web/handlers.py`** - Added chat event handlers
3. **`vector/web/service.py`** - Already had chat methods ✅
4. **`vector/agent/agent.py`** - Already had chat functionality ✅

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test the Full App

```bash
# Start the Vector web app
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m vector.web
```

Then:
1. Open browser to the displayed URL
2. Navigate to "🔍 Search & Ask" tab
3. Click on "💬 Chat" sub-tab (should be first)
4. Click "🆕 Start New Chat"
5. Type a question and click "📤 Send"
6. Ask follow-up questions
7. Verify the AI remembers context

### Option 2: Preview Just the Chat UI

```bash
# Preview the chat tab layout
.venv\Scripts\python.exe chat_ui_preview.py
```

This shows a standalone version of the chat UI with mock responses.

## Example Conversation to Try

```
You: What are R-1 residential setback requirements?
AI: [Provides detailed information from documents]

You: How about for corner lots?
AI: [Understands you're still talking about R-1 setbacks]

You: What about parking?
AI: [Provides parking info in context of the conversation]

You: Can you summarize what we discussed?
AI: [Summarizes the entire conversation]
```

## Key Features

✅ **Multi-turn Context** - AI remembers the conversation  
✅ **Document Search** - Each response grounded in your documents  
✅ **Visual Feedback** - Thumbnails show relevant document pages  
✅ **Flexible Settings** - Adjust response length, search type, etc.  
✅ **Session Management** - Start, use, and end chat sessions  
✅ **Keyboard Support** - Press Enter to send messages  

## Chat vs Ask AI

| Feature | Ask AI | Chat |
|---------|--------|------|
| Type | Single question | Conversation |
| Context | None | Full history |
| Follow-ups | Must repeat context | Natural references |
| Use case | Quick queries | Deep exploration |

## Troubleshooting

**"No active session"**
- Click "🆕 Start New Chat" first

**"AI models not available"**
- Check your config.yaml has API keys
- Verify AI models are configured

**No response**
- Check that documents are uploaded
- Verify selected documents (if filtering)

**Session seems lost**
- Don't refresh the page (sessions are in-memory)
- Start a new session if needed

## Configuration

Chat settings in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
chat:
  max_history_messages: 40          # How many messages to keep
  summary_trigger_messages: 14      # When to compress history
  max_context_results: 40           # Max search results for context
  default_top_k: 12                 # Default results per turn
```

## Architecture

```
User Types Message

Gradio Chat Tab (components.py)
    ↓
Event Handler (handlers.py)
    ↓
Web Service (service.py)
    ↓
Research Agent (agent.py)
    ↓

    ↓

```

## What to Look For

✅ Session ID appears when you click "Start New Chat"  
✅ Messages appear in chat bubbles (yours on right, AI on left)  
✅ Message input clears after sending  
✅ Thumbnails update with each response  
✅ Session info shows message count  
✅ Follow-up questions are understood in context  
✅ "End Chat" clears everything  

## Next Steps

1. **Test it**: Start the web app and try a conversation
2. **Customize**: Adjust settings in config.yaml
3. **Document**: Train your team on the new feature
4. **Feedback**: Note any improvements for future iterations
